# üè† Shawn Hoffman's Homelab

This repository contains the full declarative configuration for my personal homelab. It's built on a foundation of GitOps and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), using **Proxmox**, **Kubernetes**, **ArgoCD**, **Terraform**, and **Ansible** to manage compute, storage, networking, and services in a secure, scalable, and automated way.
